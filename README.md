Victory Conditions Overhaul 2 mod for Total War: Warhammer II.

## Introduction

This mod introduces a major redone of the victory conditions of Total War: Warhammer II Mortal Empires campaign. A lot
of members of the community, including me, think that there is a poor job done in the default ones. This results in
abandoned campaigns and poor differences between factions, which usually feel all the same in a lot of races.

With this package, a major redone of all the vanilla factions (fifty four at the moment of the writing) has been
introduced. It includes new features, new victory times and major differentiations between factions, always with a deep
respect for the rich lore of Warhammer but without being to hardcore: fun has been the main priority, lorefulness goes
after it.

To use it you only have to subscribe to the mod in the Steam Workshop, as well as satisfying its dependencies. Using the
[VCO2 Framework](https://www.github.com/msolefonte/tww2-vco2-framework/) is required and the compatibility is exactly
the same.

## Introduced changes

You can check the new victory conditions in the [Introduced changes](docs/README.md) file. There is a subfolder for each
faction improved.
