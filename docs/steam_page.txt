[h2]Introduction[/h2]
This mod introduces a major redone of the victory conditions of the Mortal Empires campaign. A lot of members of the community, including me, think that there is a poor job done in the default ones. This results in abandoned campaigns and poor differences between factions, which usually feel all the same in a lot of races.

With this package, a major redone of all the vanilla factions (fifty four at the moment of the writing) has been introduced. It includes new features, new victory times and major differentiations between factions, always with a deep respect for the rich lore of Warhammer but without being to hardore: fun has been the main priority, lorefulness goes after it.

It should be compatible with anything. Including unlockers and SFO. For any specific question, please read the FAQ.
